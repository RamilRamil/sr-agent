"""Stage 3 — deterministic finding synthesis / combination (T056, relay variant).

No LLM: two deterministic passes over the Stage 2 findings.

  1. Severity conjunction correction (reuses guardrails.severity.check_severity):
     mitigations cap severity at medium; many preconditions floor it at high.
  2. Combination: findings that interact (SIG-lite — same source file share state)
     are linked via combined_with. A conservative chain rule elevates a group of
     2+ unmitigated high/critical findings on the same target to a critical chain
     (blast-radius reasoning: interacting high-severity issues amplify).

Stage 3 returns transformed findings for the report; it does not write to memory
(append-only + supersedes requires human_input, so the raw Stage 2 records stay
as the audit trail and the report shows the synthesized view).
