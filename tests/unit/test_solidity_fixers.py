"""Feature 033 — characterization tests for the five named transform-application
sequence-functions (FR-005). Each pins ONE site's exact sequence output over a fixed
SYNTHETIC fixture (invented names only — no target material), so a future unification
(spec 034) cannot silently change a sequence.

These are the LASTING guardrail: green on the pre-extraction tree (the functions are
extracted in commit 1), and still green after the fixers move to `solidity_fixers`
(commit 4). The temporary differential test (test_fixer_extraction_diff.py) additionally
proves each function equals the REAL loop's inline output; it is removed in commit 2.
