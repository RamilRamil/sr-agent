"""Proof-pipeline eval (feature 026) — a measuring instrument for the PoC-workability harness.

SIBLING to the discovery benchmark (`bench.py`, spec 023), NOT an extension of it. Two orthogonal
axes: `bench.py` scores DISCOVERY (given a target, did we find the bug); this scores PROOF (given a
target AND a known finding AND its fix, can the harness produce a VERIFIED proof). It reuses bench.py's
disciplines — external dataset root, nothing committed, offline scoring — but is a different instrument.

It runs the existing harness (`poc_queue_runner.py`) as a BLACK BOX via its `--only`/`--fix-patch`
interface, N times per case, and reports two things:

  1. PRIMARY — the pooled fraction of case-runs reaching `passed_verified` (spec 025: falsification
     ran and the proof broke on the fix — the only trustworthy success), as a 95% Jeffreys Beta
     credible INTERVAL, never a single point. It widens with smaller N, so an underpowered run reads
     as "wide, not decisive" rather than a confident number.

  2. DIAGNOSTIC — a per-stage attrition FUNNEL (extract → draft → compiled → real_pass → verified)
     with the NAMED cases that died at each stage. It says WHAT to fix next (real_pass high but
     verified zero → the fixes are the problem, not the exploits — this session's exact situation).

Honesty rules, load-bearing:
  - The verified count is EXACTLY the harness's own `passed_verified` outcomes — never inferred, never
    model-judged. NO model anywhere in the scoring path (the same reason model-as-judge was rejected
    for the discovery benchmark). Guarded by tests/architecture/test_proof_bench_no_model.py.
  - A comparison across configs differing in anything but the harness version is FLAGGED — the exact
    guard the "3/5 vs 2/5" misread lacked.
  - Every report states N, the interval width, and that the case set is a tuned-on DEV set measuring
    within-set regression/progress, NOT absolute capability.

No scipy/numpy — the Beta quantile is a stdlib `betai` continued fraction + bisection (Decision 3).
