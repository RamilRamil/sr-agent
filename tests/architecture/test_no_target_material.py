"""Invariant: no audited-target identifier lives in the harness — above all, not in a PROMPT.

Standing project rule: bug-bounty/audited-target material (contract names, findings, paths)
NEVER enters this repo. Beyond hygiene, the PROMPT case is a correctness bug: every string in
`*_PROMPT` is sent to the model on EVERY audit, so a name borrowed from one engagement becomes
a worked example while auditing an unrelated project — irrelevant at best, and priming the model
toward an API that does not exist there at worst.

This actually happened. Live-run findings were diagnosed as "the model invented an API" when the
prompts themselves had been teaching it that project's vocabulary (`IUnstakeCooldown`, `cdo`,
`_deployStrataStack()`, `setUpSharesCooldownBase()`). Both prompts and comments were scrubbed to
neutral placeholders (`IFoo`, `_deployFooStack()`); this test keeps them scrubbed — the names get
re-introduced naturally, one paste from a run log at a time.

Scope: `scripts/` (the harness + its helpers). `tests/` is deliberately EXCLUDED — several test
fixtures still carry these names as test data; that is a separate, no-runtime-impact cleanup.
Docs are excluded too: `docs/roadmap.md`'s live-run history needs the real names to stay
intelligible as a record of what happened.
