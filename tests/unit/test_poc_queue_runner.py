"""build_file_manifest / build_callable_api: AST-backed grounding (feature 007 T020)
+ the per-name budget fairness / location-priority fix (2026-07-05).

Mirrors the exact motivating incident from the live H-01 run: with several
contract names in one finding's `location`, an earlier name's own budget-hungry
block previously starved a later name out of the prompt entirely, and even after
giving each name its own share, the actual finding-target function could still be
truncated out if declared after other functions in the same file.
