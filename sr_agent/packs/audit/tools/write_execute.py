    `foundry_test_dir` sets the Foundry test-discovery dir via the FOUNDRY_TEST

    live outside the default `test/` dir (e.g. `audit/poc/`), else forge reports
    "No tests to run". `via_ir` and remappings are inherited from the default
    profile unchanged.

    `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry` has `ENTRYPOINT=["/bin/sh","-c"]` (shell form) —
    passing the command as an argv list double-wraps under the image's own
    `sh -c` and the real command is never actually run: `sh -c "sh" "-c" "cmd"`
    executes the *script text* "sh" with "-c"/"cmd" as its $0/$1, which just
    reads stdin and exits 0 with no output (see docs/roadmap.md gotcha #3,
    root-caused 2026-07-02 — a "passed" PoC test that never actually compiled).
    The fix is to always hand the image a SINGLE command string.

    Always passes `--offline`: this sandbox always runs with `--network none`
    (Constitution I), so forge WILL fail to reach binaries.soliditylang.org
    regardless; `--offline` makes it fail cleanly ("solc not installed") using
    whatever solc is already cached in the image rather than hanging on a DNS
    timeout (docs/roadmap.md gotcha #6 — `--offline` must NOT be combined with
    `--use`, a confirmed upstream bug, foundry-rs/foundry#2412 — omit `--use`
    and let forge auto-detect the pragma-resolved version from the cache).
    A Foundry image used with this sandbox MUST have its target project's solc
    version(s) pre-baked (see docker/Dockerfile.foundry) or every run fails.
